### **Heya**

My name is koba, nice to meet you!

I'm a musicain who also sometimes works on coding and art on the side, and I love playing and modifying video games.

This blog will (hopefully) be a place where I document and chronicle different events in my life relating to those topics.

Maybe you'll be able to find interest in the stuff I write, and if you do, I hope I can bring some enjoyment from it!

Thanks for checking out the blog. You can always go back to my main site [here](https://kobacat.com/) if you get lost.

Later.
